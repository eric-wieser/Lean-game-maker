# Lean Game Maker

This library renders structured Lean files into an interactive game with a javascript Lean server running on the browser.
See the [Natural number game](https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/) for an implementation of this game.

The games built with this library work best in Chrome and Firefox.

## Acknowledgements

This fork aims at adding new features to the great original project of [mpedramfar](https://github.com/mpedramfar/Lean-game-maker/):

- Hinted proofs: parts of the proof are shown to the player, who only needs to complete the remaining sorry(s).
- View Source: A new button that opens the source of the current level in a Lean Web Editor, to make it easy to modify and add new levels to a game.
